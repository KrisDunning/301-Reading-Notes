# Reading 14 - Diversity and Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Reading - That time wen women stopped coding

> What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

- Personal computers became available for home use and were marketed towards men and boys.

> Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

- Experience matters, especially when there is an assumption of experience based on gender.

## Video - Employee breakdown of key technology companies

> When are diversity efforts most successful?

- When driven by a commitment from company leaders.

> Why do diverse companies perform better?

- Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and thus, faster/better ways of solving it. 

> Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

- Youtube didnt consider left handed users when creating the ios app. 5-10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.

## Things I want to know more about

Diversity data was from 2017. I wonder what it looks like now 5 years later, post pandemic and considering remote work.
