# Reading 06- NODE.JS

> What is node.js?

- It is a javaScript runtime built on chrom's V8 javaScript engine

> In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

- Open source JS engine that compiles to native machine code and is "targeted" by many products.

> What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

- Node is a program that we can use to execute JS on computers. We run the program and it executes JS. 

> What is npm?

- Node Package Manager. It comes bundled with Node.

> What version of node are you running on your machine?

- v18.3.0

> What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- 8.11.0

> What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

- npm install -g jshint (-g flag is for global install)

> What is node used for?

- allow us to install and manage packages/dependencies for our projects via NPM. Also node allows us run javaScript on the server. Not only this but also can be used as a scripting language, can be used to write your own CLI tool and also to build cross-platform desktop apps.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming 

> What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

- 1 Greater Efficiency
- 2 Engaged Collaborations
- 3 Learning from Fellow Students
- 4 Social Skills
- 5 Job Interview Readiness
- 6 Work Environment Readiness

> In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

- Engaged Collaboration

> How does pair programming work?

- Driver is the typer and the only one who physically writes the code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the driver. The navigator thinks big picture and checks for bugs or typos (ugh these are time killers). 

## Things I want to know more about

- Node.js , just all of it. It's such and expansive topic that I could probably take 2 or 3 courses just on its uses. But I'd be interested most in the desktop app. Just back-end and server stuff that is accessable via a PWA or webpage?
