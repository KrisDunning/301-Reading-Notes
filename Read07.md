# Reading 07- REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

> Who is Roy Fielding?

- Some guy, he's smart. Helped write the HTTP protocal.

> Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- It wasn't designed for that purpose in mind. They just needed to talk to any computer in the world, not talk to ALL the machines in the world. 

> What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- HTTP

> What does a GET do?

- retrieves data from a compter

> What does a POST do?

- add something to another system

> What does PUT do?

- update something on another system

> What does PATCH do?

- partially update something on another system


## Things I want to know more about

- SOAP? sound familiar. Why was it the fancy magic version of protocol that got left begind?
