# Reading 13- More CRUD

CRUD is the basic staple of data manipulation. We will be using it everyday. More learning about it the better.

## Reading CRUD Basics

> Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

- PUT method

> Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

- PUT and DELETE methods

## Video: Speed Coding - Building a CRUD API

> Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

- 1 to 1. Create = post, Read= read, Update= put, Delete=delete.

> If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

- 1) Tools and dependency install/require
- 2) Setup/test Routes to API endpoints
- 3) Setup/connect to database
- 4) Setup schema and seed data
- 5) Test API/ REST commands and confirm DB updates
