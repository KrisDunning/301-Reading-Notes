# Reading 01- Introduction to React and Components

React and Component based architecture matter to me because the react library is widely used in real world web development and components are a common way to structure a webpages code design. Becoming familiar with these concepts and practices will improve my overall coding knowledge. 


## Component-Based Architecture

- What is a “component”? - A component encapsulates functionality and behaviors of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit.  
- What are the characteristics of a component? - Reusability, Replaceable, Not Context Specific, Extensible, Encapsulated, Independent.
- What are the advantages of using component-based architecture? - Ease of deployment, Reduced Cost, Ease of development, Reusable, Modification of technical complexity, Reliability, System maintenance and evolution, Independent.  

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

- What is “props” short for? - Properties.
- How are props used in React? - They are used to pass data from one component to another. (Read-Only Data, should not be changed by child components)
- What is the flow of props? - One-way flow from parent to child.


## Things I want to know more about

- Is this an alternative to OOP? Can OOP concepts be applied to components? such as classes? Or is that too tightly coupled? I would think that a class instantiation should be acceptable for a component.
